## Work Organization

* PostgreSQL with the pgAdmin GUI and MS Excel
  * Data import, database management and data wrangling 
have been performed in PostgreSQL with the IDE pgAdmin. 
  * The database cohort-analysis has been created in PostgreSQL. 
  * Cohort analysis has been conducted in PostgreSQL as well 
but also in Excel with pivot tables.
  * Visualization has been performed in Excel. 

* R Markdown
  * The final report 70_cohort_analysis_final_report.html
has been produced in R Markdown by knitting the file 69_cohort_analysis_final_report.Rmd. 

* CSV files and LibreOffice Calc
  * Input data are stored in the zipped CSV file 01_data_import_from_recommendation_project.zip. 
  * Data have also been transferred in CSV format between SQL, Excel and R Markdown. 
  * CSV files have been produced in Calc from LibreOffice (for technical convenience with decimal separator). 

* Graphs in PNG format
  * Graphs have been transferred in PNG format.

## Summary

  * In the project Recommendation System (see corresponding repository in this account), 
the 10-milllion-row MovieLens data set (see *https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/* )
has been analyzed. Time impact was a predictor, rather limited though. 

  * This project further elaborates on the idea of time impact by investigating 
the notion of cohort behavioral patterns. It analyzes a one-million-row extract 
from the 10-milllion-row MovieLens data set. 

  * This allows to deliver additional insights about data time component and usersâ€™ behavioral patterns 
and could help to predict ratings when revisiting the Recommendation System project. 

  * More explanation is provided in the final report 
*70_cohort_analysis_final_report.html*, 
as well of course as the insights gained from this cohort analysis.
