# Cohort-Analysis

This cohort analysis relates to a one-million-row extract 
from the 10-milllion-row MovieLens data set (recommendation system). 
It allows to better analyze the time component from data. 
This can help to study users’ behavioral patterns 
and also to predict ratings.  

This data analysis project is comprised of 70 files:
-	7 SQL files,
-	13 XLSX files,
-	35 CSV files,
-	13 PNG files, 
-	1 Rmd (R Markdown) file 
-	and 1 HTML file. 

Data import, database management and data wrangling 
have been performed in PostgreSQL with the IDE pgAdmin. 
A database (called “cohort-analysis”) has been created in PostgreSQL. 
Cohort analysis has been conducted in PostgreSQL as well 
but also in Excel with pivot tables and graphs. 

The final HTML report (70_cohort_analysis_final_report.html) 
has been produced in R Markdown (69_cohort_analysis_final_report.Rmd). 

Input data are stored in a zipped CSV file:  
01_data_import_from_recommendation_project.zip. 

Data have also been transferred in CSV format between SQL, Excel and R Markdown. 
CSV files have been produced in Calc from LibreOffice 
(for technical convenience with decimal separator). 

Graphs have been transferred in PNG format. 

More explanation is provided in the final report 
(70_cohort_analysis_final_report.html), 
as well of course as the insights gained from this cohort analysis.
